# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Mini Projects
Welcome to Deep-Learning-Mini-Projects, for exploring the exciting world of Deep Learning! This repository is based on the deep learning courses that I enrolled in ECE, UT, offering a collection of engaging mini-projects that will equip you with practical skills and a deeper understanding of Deep Learning concepts.

**Sharpen Your Skills, Tackle Diverse Problems:**

This repository goes beyond theory, providing hands-on projects that address various real-world Deep Learning challenges. Dive into topics like:

### XAI
* **Generalization in Classification:** Understand how well your models perform on unseen data.
* **Robustness in Classification:** Explore how to make your models resilient to adversarial attacks and noise.
* **Interpretability in Tabular Data:** Gain insights into your model's decision-making process for structured data.
* **Interpretability in Image Data:** Uncover the hidden patterns your models use to recognize objects in images.
* **(and more to come!)**
