### Problem Statement

Diabetes is a prevalent health issue worldwide, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective management. This project aims to build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on various health indicators. Additionally, we focus on interpreting the model's predictions to ensure transparency and fairness.

### Solution Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing and Exploration**:
   - **Load Dataset**: We use the diabetes dataset containing features such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, and others.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We perform correlation analysis, visualize the distribution of features, and identify outliers to understand the data better.
   - **Normalization**: Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance.
   - **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance reliably.

2. **Model Building**:
   - **Neural Network Model**: We design a neural network with multiple layers and train it on the training dataset.
   - **Training Process**: The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and Binary Cross-Entropy Loss for 25 epochs. We monitor training and validation loss, accuracy, and precision during the training process.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: After training, we evaluate the model on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. A confusion matrix is also generated to provide more insights into the model's performance.

4. **Model Interpretation**:
   - **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**: We use LIME to interpret individual predictions, providing insights into how different features contribute to the model's decisions.
   - **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: SHAP values are computed to understand the overall impact of each feature on the model's predictions.
   - **Manual Feature Perturbation**: We manually perturb feature values to see how changes affect the model's predictions, further validating feature importance.

5. **NAM (Neural Additive Models)**:
   - **NAM Classifier**: An additional model, NAMClassifier, is trained to provide an alternative perspective on feature importance.
   - **Feature Importance**: We compute and plot feature importance scores to identify the most influential features in predicting diabetes.

### Key Results
- **Training and Validation**: The neural network model showed promising results in training with a final validation accuracy of approximately 81%.
- **Test Performance**: The model achieved a test accuracy of 81.8%, precision of 0.81, recall of 0.61, and F1 score of 0.61.
- **Interpretability**: LIME and SHAP analysis revealed that features like glucose levels and age significantly impact predictions, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals.

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting diabetes and highlights the importance of model interpretability in ensuring fair and transparent predictions.
